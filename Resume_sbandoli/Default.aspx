    <h3>Welcome to my Resume</h3>

        <p>This is home to some of my many accomplishments.  Including life experiences, job history, and my education.
            This page right here is to represent my character and any interests I may have in life.
            But you can hop over to some other pages in the navigation bar to see some more important parts of my life
        <br /></p>


    <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have many hobbies but I would list a few of them as playing games with my friends or alone sometimes.  I'm a big movie fanatic, so I enjoy watching some films from time to time 
            always something new to watch, whether it's good or not is another story entirely.  My favorite genres would be sci-fi fantasy and horror.
            I do code and keep up to date with my skills from time to time, this is usually html, css, and javascript since I use those the most, 
            but I do try to keep up with my logic thinking since that's very important for coding practice.<br /><br />
            
            That's about it for the majority of my hobbies and interests, but go ahead and check out the Job History, Education and Experience pages for some more info, 
            and the contact page if you'd like to get in touch with me personally.
        <br /></p>
